It is becoming more and more important for businesses to use Machine Learning (ML) models to take advantage
of data’s predictive power. However, 60% of ML models never make it to production. These models often fail to deliver
the intended results because of inadequate considerations of the shift in people, processes, and platforms needed
to effectively operate in a responsive, agile technology environment. Rackspace’s new Machine Learning Operations
Foundations offering (MLOps), powered by Rackspace Technology Model Factory Framework, can help you innovate your
data landscape, even if you don't have all the technical expertise to efficiently move Machine Learning models into production.

The Rackspace Technology Model Factory Framework is built with open source tools that enables rapid development,
training, scoring, and deployment of models. The MLOps Solution can be tailored to specific workflows and business
needs through customization around the Model Factory Framework. Rackspace leverages the innovative capabilities of
the cloud to help customers build new revenue streams, increase efficiency, and deliver incredible experiences.
Rackspace teams employ industry best practices and a wide range of expertise across data migration, data engineering,
data science, machine learning, and operations to help turn your data into a tool for innovation.

### Features and benefits

**Standardized model development environment for your data science teams:** Allows your data science and
engineering teams to develop models with support for any machine learning framework.

**Automated model deployment across development, Q/A, and production environments:** Leverages hyper-scale
cloud automation to quickly take models from development to deployment, while addressing the production-ready
requirements of high availability, scalability, reliability and cost-management.

**Reproducibility of models and predictions:** Track model versions and hyper-parameters,
when deploying to different environments, ensuring model performance in development matches model performance in production.

**Tools for diagnostics, performance monitoring & addressing model drift:**  Provides tools for data science teams to address
model drift, model performance for debugging and troubleshooting as well as pipeline management.

**Model explainability for governance and regulatory compliance:** Track models, data and parameters in case you need to
show auditors that the proper protocols were employed.

**Platform for collaboration:** Combines DevOps tools and processes with machine learning workflows. Teams
can work closely together to develop complex models and pipelines and manage model progression through the
different stages of development to production, with respective versions, annotations and history

**Accelerated ROI:** Expedite operationalizing models in production and realize the benefits of
an automated cloud-based machine learning lifecycle management solution with a pay-for-what-you-use
model. This includes tools and services to help you monitor and optimize your compute resources


### Conclusion:

With MLOps, Rackspace can help you reduce the typical 25+ step lifecycle to 10 steps or less.
This results in a significantly faster delivery time to accelerate operationalizing models in production.

The Model Factory Framework enables support for numerous ML models in production and development through
Continuous Integration/ Continuous development (CI/CD) for data science and automated workflows for development,
QA, and production. Rackspace experts tailor this service to your specific workflows and business needs
while implementing relevant best practices.
